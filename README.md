# Probabilistic Back-projection algorithm 

In this repository are included the Matlab codes needed to carry out the probabilistic back-projection of an event. These codes were originally developed for the study Li and Gudmundsson, 2020, and extended for the study Tary et al., 2025. 


To locate an event in 2D with a constant velocity, use
